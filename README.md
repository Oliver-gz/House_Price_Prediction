# House_Price_Prediction

## About the Project
This project comes from a Kaggle competition: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) and was used as a Data Analytics course project. It can be a good practice of data exploration, feature engineering and some regression techniques in machine learning. 

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It can act as an expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. For details of this dataset, apart from the above Kaggle link, you can also find the original paper work [here](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf). I've uploaded both the original dataset and Kaggle competition dataset.
